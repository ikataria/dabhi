# About Dabhi
> The word 'Dabhi' is used to refer a friend in Haryana(India). So before starting this project I decided this name for my social networking application as the motive of this application is to make new friends. 

## Introduction

> This is a social networking application which is develop from scratch using node for processing, mongoDb for database, middleware http handling using expressJS framework. Only backend is ready for now and is deployed on Heroku. 

## To-do List

* FrontEnd :- Angular will be used for this app's frontEnd.   
* Chat system :- For this I will use socket.io
* User Location :- In this API, if an user allows another user to access his/her location, then he/she will be able to see one's location. We will be using google maps for this.
* Configure an SMS provider if free :)  
* Barcode for each User (Just for practice) 

## Application URL

* https://dabhi.herokuapp.com/

> This app's API can only be hit by postman as along as we don't have frontEnd.
* Example :- "https://dabhi.herokuapp.com/registration/login"
